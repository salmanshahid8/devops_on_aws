# Module 1

## Build and Source branches practices
- DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. Put simply, DevOps is a way for development teams and operations teams to work better together and ultimately share the responsibility of the software they build.
- You can use AWS CodeBuild for continuous integration (CI) practices. It compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. It also reduces the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. With CodeBuild, you only pay for the service when you are using it.
- In this course, you also learned about two important things to configure so you can get your build processes into CodeBuild: a build project and a build specification (buildspec) file.
    - Build project - Includes information about how to run a build, including where to get the source code, which build environment to use, which build commands to run, and where to store the build output.
    - Buildspec file - Is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build.
